tjconwayy1997,Tconwayy97,For the people who post on social media  asking if jobs are hiring......get the fuck off social media and look on Google
ozsultan,Oz Sultan,"Where do you manufacture this stuff?

The roles aren’t being filled, H1B Desis were halted by the administration and Trade education is needed to fill the massive hiring gaps - reason enough for Google and MSFT to drop their bachelors requirements for entry level hires"
fams2gether,Families Belong Together,"Hey, @Google: do the right thing and stop hiring people who separate families. No one who helped to torment children should get a promotion, it’s time for Google to recognize that. #NoSoftLandinghttps://petitions.moveon.org/sign/google-stand-with-children?source=c.em&r_by=21717654 …"
DamienDefils,Damien Defils,"Yeah but what about when Google came to CA? Facebook? This was the cities decision to allow them to come, expand, and bring countless others into the state while paying little to no taxes. Hiring white and then buying homes that people still lived in and evicting them."
invisiblepeople,Invisible People,"In 2020, @invisiblepeople will scale up our educational content creating curriculums for schools. We are already hiring more housed and homeless writers to grow our journalism. We will launch on Google News. We're producing mini-docs, and we're gonna road trip around the country."

WazzusJobu,WazzusJobu,You call for hiring a real DC but then champ for a dude that has no experience calling a defense. I mean Manning doesn’t hold a candle to Claeys resume on being a DC. It didn’t work out. Happens a lot in Pullman. Jake Dicker should be the DC. He can coach. Google it. https://twitter.com/IanFurnessSea/status/1210822348225404928 …
EmmaTolkin,Emma “J.R.R.” Tolkin,"A while back my friend googled the right series of questions/searches about coding, & suddenly his fkn browser CRACKED OPEN (visually not literally), like the results page turned black, fell backwards, & he got invited 2 apply for a job at google. NGL kinda dope hiring strategy??"
DAvallone,David Avallone,"Google David Sirota’s past history. Sirota is still working for him. Bernie doesn’t care about hiring bigots: he cares about getting caught hiring bigots. 

He’s not the messiah. He’s a fraud. It’s not too late for you to figure this out."
KingCyrusIII,Captain Liberty,"@Twitter @TwitterSupport
Google translate is way off. Seldomly it is accurate. Especially when translating Asian languages such as Persian (Iran/Farsi) into European languages. 

I recommend hiring native speakers.

You can also try other services."
